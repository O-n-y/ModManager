# Guide for Mod Creaters
## Mod version

For your mod version information to be loaded and showed correctly in Mods list dialog:

* **For .dll mods**, it will read version from **AssemblyInfo.cs -> AssemblyVersion**. If you mod have multiple .dll, you can store version info in *version.info* (see information below).
* **For other**, it will search for file *version.info* in mod directory.
  * If version info not found, it will create *version.info.tpl*. 
  * You can open it with text editor and edit version there.
  * Then save it and rename to *version.info*, upload this file with all other files of your mod.

      <Version>1.0.0.0</Version>
    </VersionInfo>

Upload *version.info* with other files of your mod using Oxygen Not Included Uploader.


## Mod Creator Links to Discord, Github and Patreon

For your links to be displayed near your mod in Mods list dialog:
![mod links](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/O-n-y/ModManager/master/ModLinks.png)
* Create *mod.info* file with following content (replace links to your actual) in your mod root folder
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ModInfoData xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Discord>https://discord.gg/S6d25A</Discord>
  <Github>https://github.com/O-n-y/oxy.mods</Github>
  <Patreon>https://www.patreon.com/ony_mods</Patreon>
</ModInfoData>
```
If link is black, icon won't be shown, so if do not have for example Discord link - leave it blank

Example of *mod.info* also can be found here: https://github.com/O-n-y/ModManager/blob/master/mod.info

Upload *mod.info* with other files of your mod using Oxygen Not Included Uploader.
